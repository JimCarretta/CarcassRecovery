####  Under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), NOAA assesses human-caused injuries and mortalities of marine mammals through a <a href="https://media.fisheries.noaa.gov/dam-migration/02-238.pdf">Serious Injury Policy</a> and <a href="https://media.fisheries.noaa.gov/dam-migration/02-238-01.pdf">Procedural Directive</a>. Injuries are defined as 'non-serious' or 'serious', where the latter is defined as *<b>"any injury that is more likely than not to result in mortality, or any injury that presents a greater than 50 percent chance of death to a marine mammal"</b>*.

####  NOAA is reviewing the Serious Injury policy and procedures for large whales with new data and assessing a new Random Forest method to estimate individual probabilities of a health decline, death, or recovery for entanglements and vessel strikes. 

####  The major proposed change is that current serious injury procedures requiring biologists to assess a series of conditions , e.g. 

#### <b>*"Was entangling gear constricting or loose?"*</b> 

#### could be automated using a Random Forest (RF) algorithm. The RF model uses covariates derived from key words and phrases in injury narratives known to be good predictors of non-serious vs serious injuries.

#### Methods, R functions, and application examples for large whale data are summarized in the R-Package *<a href="https://github.com/JimCarretta/SeriousInjury">SeriousInjury</a>* and are summarized on this website.

#### To install the latest *SeriousInjury* version from GitHub:
```
# make sure you have devtools installed
if (!require('devtools')) install.packages('devtools')

# install from GitHub
devtools::install_github('JimCarretta/SeriousInjury')
```
