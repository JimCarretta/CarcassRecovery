#### Covariates are derived from injury narratives with the function '*InjuryCovariates()*'. Code to define, maintain, and extract covariates from narratives is found in the R-script *InjuryCovariates.R*. Covariates are defined below.
  
#### Definitions:

#### <b>*anchored*</b>
<p>Evidence a whale was anchored or immobilized by                                entangling material or gear.  Narrative mentions                                  inability to dive or swim or that whale is                                        immobilized. Includes references to a                                             heavily-weighted whale with multiple pots/traps                                   impeding normal movement.</p>

#### <b>*calf.juv*</b>
<p>Narrative includes reference to an injured calf or juvenile. Also includes narratives where injury involves the mother of a dependent calf.</p>

#### <b>*constricting*</b>
<p>Evidence of a constricting entanglement, including line cutting into whale, wrapped tightly around body or flippers.</p>

#### <b>*decline*</b>
<p>Narrative includes evidence of a health decline, such as the presence of cyamids, emaciation, discolored skin, deformities caused by a chronic entanglement or severe vessel strike incident.</p>

#### <b>*extensive.severe*</b>	
<p>Evidence of severe injury that can include amputation or necrosis of body parts due to a chronic entanglement or acute vessel strike injury.</p>

#### <b>*fluke.peduncle*</b>
<p>Narrative includes reference of entanglement or vessel strike injury that involves the tail, flukes, or peduncle.</p>

#### <b>*gear.free*</b>	
<p>Evidence that the whale freed itself from the gear or entangling material. Typically involves a whale resighted at a later date than the initial entanglement observation.</p>

#### <b>*head*</b>	
<p>Narrative indicates that the head, mouth, or blowhole was involved in the entanglement or vessel strike injury.</p>

#### <b>*healing*</b>
<p>Narrative refers to healing or healed wounds.</p>

#### <b>*laceration.deep*</b>
<p>Narrative includes reference to deep laceration resulting from vessel strike or entanglement. May include reference to blubber or muscle layers.</p>

#### <b>*laceration.shallow*</b>
<p>Narrative includes reference to shallow or superficial lacerations.</p>

#### <b>*pectoral*</b>
<p>Narrative includes involvement of pectoral flipper or ‘fins’ in entanglement or vessel strike injury.</p>

#### <b>*swim.dive*</b>
<p>Evidence that the whale is swimming, feeding, or diving normally.</p>

#### <b>*trailing*</b>			
<p>Was the whale trailing gear or other entangling material?</p>

#### <b>*VessSpd*</b>
<p>Vessel Speed, coded as a factor with 3 possible states: unknown=VSpdUnk, slow=VSpdSlow, fast=VSpdFast.  Based on speed references or inferences from 'Narrative'.  Speeds <=10 kts are considered slow, >10 kts are fast. </p>

#### <b>*VessSz*</b>
<p>Vessel Size, coded as a factor with 3 possible states: unknown=VSzUnk, small=VSzSmall, large=VSzLarge.  Based on size references or inferences from 'Narrative'.  Sizes <=65 ft are considered 'small', unless the vessel is much larger than whale. Sizes > 65 ft are considered 'large'.</p> 

#### <b>*vessel.slow*</b>
<p>Narrative includes reference to vessel speeds >= 10 kts.</p>

#### <b>*vessel.small*</b>
<p>Narrative includes reference to small vessels such as sailboats, recreational vessels, RHIB vessels, or vessel size < 65 ft in length or smaller than the whale, if this can be determined.</p>

#### <b>*wraps.multi*</b>
<p>Narrative includes reference to whale with  multiple wraps of line or gear around body or appendage.</p>

#### <b>*wraps.no*</b>
<p>Narrative includes reference to a whale without any wraps of line or gear around body or appendage.</p>
