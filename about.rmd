title: "Package *SeriousInjury*: Estimate Probability of Non-Serious vs Serious Injuries for Large Whales"
---
***
#### The R-Package *SeriousInjury* uses Random Forest (RF) classification trees to assess injury severity of large whale entanglements and vessel strikes. Models are built using the R-Package *rfPermute*.

![Figure 1. Example decision tree used to classify whale injuries as serious or non-serious. Data are based on known-outcome entanglement and vessel strike cases, where a known-outcome is a documented death, health decline, or recovery 1 year or more post-interaction. Deaths and health declines are considered serious injuries and recoveries are considered non-serious injuries.](Tree Examples (2).PNG)

![Figure 2. Multiple bootstrap trees (*a random forest*) are used to classify OOB or novel cases. The fraction of trees 'voting' for a particular class represents the probability of that case belonging to the class *Dead.Decline*  or *Recovered*.  ](Tree Examples (1).PNG)
