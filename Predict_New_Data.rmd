### Use existing Random Forest models to predict probability of a death, health decline or recovery for novel cases where the outcome is unknown.


#### Estimate the probability of a non-serious or serious injury using example code below. Both *Dead.Decline* and *Recovered* probabilities are estimated, based on the fraction of Random Forest tree assignments to each class. A binary prediction (either *Dead.Decline* or *Recovered*) is also returned, based on the majority class assignment (>50% of trees). In case of ties, which are rare, the model randomly assigns a class.

```
# 'data.test.entangle' data.frame with required field name 'Narrative' and appended covariates.

head(data.test.entangle)

# Apply existing 'ModelEntanglement' to data.test.entangle to generate binary and probabilistic model predictions

majority.prediction <- predict(ModelEntanglement, data.test.entangle, type='response')
prob.prediction <- predict(ModelEntanglement, data.test.entangle, type='prob')

predictions.df <- cbind.data.frame(majority.prediction, prob.prediction, data.test.entangle)
head(predictions.df)

```
