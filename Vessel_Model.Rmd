#### The Vessel Strike Model (ModelVessel) is an object of class *rfPermute* that includes x observations of known-outcome injury cases, representing y species. Vessel injury cases are included as the data.frame *VesselData* in the R-Package *SeriousInjury*.

```
# Create randomForest model (using R-Package rfPermute) using known-outcome vessel strike data

# make sure you have devtools installed
if (!require('devtools')) install.packages('devtools')

# install from GitHub
devtools::install_github('EricArcher/rfPermute')

library(rfPermute)

# set.seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# how many RF trees to build
size.RF = 1000

# covariates included in ModelVessel

# balance sample size for each health class; we are equally-interested in correctly      
#  predicting non-serious and serious injuries
